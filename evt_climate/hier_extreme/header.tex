\section{Abstract}
\label{abstract}

This paper extends estimation of the extremal index to the Bayesian hierarchical setting based on likelihoods provided by \cite{ferro2003inference} and \cite{suveges2010model}. A comparison of the two likelihoods is made using coverage and root mean squared error (RMSE). The hierarchical model is applied to simulated data and CanCM4 climate model simulations.
